Mark Mackesy has had his share of success in more than three decades of racing stock cars on short tracks around Wisconsin. His list of accomplishments includes four season titles at Wausau's State Park Speedway.  But there's another family member the Wausau resident believes has the potential to make an even bigger mark in the sport. Mackesy entered last Thursday's State Park competition with a chance to win the Flip Merwin Memorial for the fourth time in the 14 years of the super late model feature. But the prerace conversation turned to his 19-year-old nephew, Dillon, a limited late model driver whose car was stationed a handful of spots away among the long row of haulers.
